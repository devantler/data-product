This repo contains a Data Product as defined by Zhamak Dehghani in the Book [Data Mesh](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-mesh/9781492092384/). A data product is the central unit of the data mesh, and operates as a service that provides dedicated data storage, data processing, data discovery-, and data governance- tooling for a specific domain model. In this context, a domain model is the schema of some data that covers a concrete domain, e.g. Accounts, Books, Authors etc.

The data product is built to support most cloud providers and provisioning tools by being built as a container.
